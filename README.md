# Bank-Management-System-Object-Oriented-Programming-

A robust **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application built to demonstrate the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This project transforms a simple banking concept into a scalable software system by applying advanced C++ techniques and structured software design.

---

##  Project Overview
The system manages clients, users, and financial transactions through a structured hierarchy. It focuses on **code reusability**, **maintainability**, and simulating a real-world banking environment where security and data integrity are paramount.

##  Key Technical Implementations

###  OOP Pillars & Design
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting sensitive financial data and ensuring internal states are modified only through well-defined interfaces.
* **Inheritance:** Implementing a logical hierarchy between different system entities (e.g., Persons, Clients, and Users).
* **Polymorphism:** Utilizing virtual functions to provide specific implementations for shared behaviors.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex logic behind simple, reusable class methods.

###  Data Persistence
* **Flat-File Database:** Efficient handling of data using **File Systems** (Reading/Writing to text files) to ensure data is saved and retrieved correctly between sessions.
* **Data Parsing:** Advanced string manipulation to convert record lines into objects and vice versa.

##  Key Features
* **Client Management:** Complete CRUD operations (Add, Delete, Update, and Find) for bank clients.
* **Transaction Module:** * Secure Deposits and Withdrawals.
    * Real-time balance tracking.
    * **Transfer Log:** Detailed tracking and recording of all internal transfers between accounts.
* **Security & User Permissions:** * Secure Login system.
    * Fine-grained Access Control (Permissions) for each user to restrict access to specific system functions.
* **Robust Logic:** Strong input validation and error handling to prevent logical flaws during financial operations.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Storage:** Text Files (Data Persistence)
* **Environment:** Console Application (CLI)

##  Core Concepts Learned
- Designing modular systems using **Header Files** and **Classes**.
- Managing relationships between objects.
- Building a professional **Menu-Driven Interface** for CLI tools.
- Handling file-based databases effectively.
